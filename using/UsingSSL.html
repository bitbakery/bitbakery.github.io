<h1>Using SSL</h1>

<p>The following material has been taken from Wikipedia entries for SSL and HTTPS.</p>

<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols
    that provide communication security over the Internet. They use asymmetric cryptography for authentication of key exchange,
    symmetric encryption for confidentiality and message authentication codes for message integrity. Several versions of the
    protocols are in widespread use in applications such as web browsing, electronic mail, Internet faxing, instant messaging
    and voice-over-IP (VoIP).</p>

<p>In the TCP/IP model view, TLS and SSL encrypt the data of network connections at a lower sublayer of its application layer.
    In OSI model equivalences, TLS/SSL is initialized at layer 5 (the session layer) then works at layer 6 (the presentation layer):
    first the session layer has a handshake using an asymmetric cipher in order to establish cipher settings and a shared key for that session;
    then the presentation layer encrypts the rest of the communication using a symmetric cipher and that session key. In both models,
    TLS and SSL work on behalf of the underlying transport layer, whose segments carry encrypted data.</p>


<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>The TLS protocol allows client-server applications to communicate across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.</p>

<p>Since protocols can operate either with or without TLS (or SSL), it is necessary for the client to indicate to the server
    whether it wants to set up a TLS connection or not. There are two main ways of achieving this; one option is to use a
    different port number for TLS connections (for example port 443 for HTTPS). The other is to use the regular port number
    and have the client request that the server switch the connection to TLS using a protocol specific mechanism (for example
    STARTTLS for mail and news protocols).</p>

<p>Once the client and server have decided to use TLS, they negotiate a stateful connection by using a handshaking procedure.
    During this handshake, the client and server agree on various parameters used to establish the connection's security:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The client sends the server the client's SSL version number, cipher settings, session-specific data, and other
        information that the server needs to communicate with the client using SSL.</li>
    <li>The server sends the client the server's SSL version number, cipher settings, session-specific data, and other
        information that the client needs to communicate with the server over SSL. The server also sends its own certificate,
        and if the client is requesting a server resource that requires client authentication, the server requests the client's certificate.</li>
    <li>The client uses the information sent by the server to authenticate the server. If the server cannot be authenticated,
        the user is warned of the problem and informed that an encrypted and authenticated connection cannot be established.
        If the server can be successfully authenticated, the client proceeds to the next step.</li>
    <li>Using all data generated in the handshake thus far, the client (with the cooperation of the server, depending on
        the cipher in use) creates the pre-master secret for the session, encrypts it with the server's public key
        (obtained from the server's certificate, sent in step 2), and then sends the encrypted pre-master secret to the server.</li>
    <li>If the server has requested client authentication (an optional step in the handshake), the client also signs
        another piece of data that is unique to this handshake and known by both the client and server. In this case,
        the client sends both the signed data and the client's own certificate to the server along with the encrypted pre-master secret.</li>
    <li>If the server has requested client authentication, the server attempts to authenticate the client. If the client
        cannot be authenticated, the session ends. If the client can be successfully authenticated, the server uses its
        private key to decrypt the pre-master secret, and then performs a series of steps (which the client also performs,
        starting from the same pre-master secret) to generate the master secret.</li>
    <li>Both the client and the server use the master secret to generate the session keys, which are symmetric keys used
        to encrypt and decrypt information exchanged during the SSL session and to verify its integrity (that is, to detect
        any changes in the data between the time it was sent and the time it is received over the SSL connection).</li>
    <li>The client sends a message to the server informing it that future messages from the client will be encrypted with
        the session key. It then sends a separate (encrypted) message indicating that the client portion of the handshake is finished.</li>
    <li>The server sends a message to the client informing it that future messages from the server will be encrypted with
        the session key. It then sends a separate (encrypted) message indicating that the server portion of the handshake is finished.</li>
</ol>
<p>The SSL handshake is now complete and the session begins. The client and the server use the session keys to encrypt and decrypt the data they send to each other and to validate its integrity.</p>
<p>This is the normal operation condition of the secure channel. At any time, due to internal or external stimulus (either automation or user intervention), either side may renegotiate the connection, in which case, the process repeats itself.</p>
<p>This concludes the handshake and begins the secured connection, which is encrypted and decrypted with the key material until the connection closes.</p>
<p>If any one of the above steps fails, the TLS handshake fails and the connection is not created.</p>

<h3>HTTPS</h3>

<p>HTTPS is a URI scheme which has identical syntax to the standard HTTP scheme, aside from its scheme token. However,
    HTTPS signals the browser to use an added encryption layer of SSL/TLS to protect the traffic. SSL is especially suited
    for HTTP since it can provide some protection even if only one side of the communication is authenticated. This is
    the case with HTTP transactions over the Internet, where typically only the server is authenticated (by the client
    examining the server's certificate).</p>

<p>HTTPS creates a secure channel over an insecure network. This ensures reasonable protection from eavesdroppers
    and man-in-the-middle attacks, provided that adequate cipher suites are used and that the server certificate is verified and trusted.</p>

<p>Because HTTPS piggybacks HTTP entirely on top of TLS, the entirety of the underlying HTTP protocol can be encrypted.
    This includes the request URL (which particular web page was requested), query parameters, headers, and cookies
    (which often contain identity information about the user). However, because host (web site) addresses and port numbers
    are necessarily part of the underlying TCP/IP protocols, HTTPS cannot protect their disclosure. In practice this means
    that even on a correctly configured web server eavesdroppers can still infer the IP address and port number of the
    web server (sometimes even the domain name e.g. www.example.org, but not the rest of the URL) that one is communicating
    with as well as the amount (data transferred) and duration (length of session) of the communication, though not the
    content of the communication.</p>

<p>Web browsers know how to trust HTTPS websites based on certificate authorities that come pre-installed in their software.
    Certificate authorities (e.g. VeriSign/Microsoft/etc.) are in this way being trusted by web browser creators to provide
    valid certificates. Logically, it follows that a user should trust an HTTPS connection to a website if and only if all of the following are true:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The user trusts that the browser software correctly implements HTTPS with correctly pre-installed certificate authorities.</li>
    <li>The user trusts the certificate authority to vouch only for legitimate websites.</li>
    <li>The website provides a valid certificate, which means it was signed by a trusted authority.</li>
    <li>The certificate correctly identifies the website (e.g., when the browser visits "https://example.com", the received certificate is properly for "Example Inc." and not some other entity).</li>
    <li>Either the intervening hops on the Internet are trustworthy, or the user trusts that the protocol's encryption layer (TLS/SSL) is sufficiently secure against eavesdroppers.</li>
</ul>
